### Hi!! Just finished up this article about loops! [Check it out](https://github.com/robingould)

jokes aside,

Iâ€™m currently working on my game/physics engine :'D. The driving concepts behind it are really unique and something I'm super proud of. I hope that I can make this into a piece of software that other people love as much as I do. 

If you have experience or knowledge about programming algorithms related to quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, bubble intersections or proprietary ambient occlusion techniques PLEASE reach out I would really appreciate it.
I have no money to pay you, but I will give you a very whole hearted and sincere thank you. 

If you wanna get in touch add me on discord: plantfriend
