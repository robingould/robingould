### Hi!! Just finished up this article about loops! [Check it out](https://github.com/robingould)

jokes aside,

### About me:
I have been passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning since I was 14 using Racket and Octave reading ‚ÄúHow to Design Programs‚Äù (the blue book). Implemented the Gradient Descent and PID control for a project model self-driving car and got a small taste of Greg Hendershotts‚Äôs ‚ÄúFear of Macros‚Äù, although I didn‚Äôt get very far. At the time I was super excited about self-driving cars and comma.ai had just come out with their first kit. I ended up saving up to buy the Honda Civic model that was most compatible with the technology, but never ended up modding the car. It‚Äôs still currently the car I have and I‚Äôll likely do the modifications after I have a job and can better afford it. 

- Currently I‚Äôm in my last semester of college at the University of Connecticut and looking for employment as a Full Stack Software Engineer, Data Analyst or Artificial Intelligence Engineer. 
- I‚Äôm highly interested in modding thinkpads, music production and physics 
- Currently researching applications of quantum mechanics techniques with collision detection
