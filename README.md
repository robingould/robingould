### About me:
Having fun with AI / ML since I was 14 using Racket and Octave reading ‚ÄúHow to Design Programs‚Äù (the blue book). Implemented the Gradient Descent and PID control for a project model self-driving car and got a small taste of Greg Hendershotts‚Äôs ‚ÄúFear of Macros‚Äù, although I didn‚Äôt get very far. At the time I was super excited about self-driving cars and comma.ai (George Hotz goat) had just come out with their first kit. I ended up saving up to buy the Honda Civic model that was most compatible with the technology, but never ended up modding the car. It‚Äôs still currently the car I have and I‚Äôll going to do the mods after I get a job and can afford it. 

- Just graduated from University of Connecticut in Compsci + Data Analytics with a math minor and looking for employment as a doing Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or as a Full Stack Software Engineer. 
- I‚Äôm interested in modding thinkpads, music production and physics/materials science
- Currently researching applications of physics techniques with collision detection
