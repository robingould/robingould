### Hi! 👋, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you.

I'm from the US, currently EST. I went to the University of Connecticut for computer science, with a specialization in Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I’m interested in ML/AI and its applications in finance, music and physics.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with two early stage startup projects, AI-powered tools for livestreamers and fintech tools.
- ✏️ My current personal project will automatically link & coordinate between music sources with RAG, check it out [here](https://github.com/robingould/music-linker)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about Redis :)
