### 🤔 About me:
Having fun with AI / ML since I was 14 using Racket and Octave reading “How to Design Programs” (the blue book). Implemented the Gradient Descent and PID control for a project model self-driving car and got a small taste of Greg Hendershotts’s “Fear of Macros”, although I didn’t get very far. At the time I was super excited about self-driving cars and comma.ai (George Hotz goat) had just come out with their first kit. I ended up saving up to buy the Honda Civic model that was most compatible with the technology, but never ended up modding the car. It’s still currently the car I have and I’ll going to do the mods after I get a job and can afford it. 

- Just graduated from University of Connecticut in Compsci + Data Analytics with a math minor and looking for employment as a doing Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or as a Full Stack Software Engineer. 
- I’m interested in modding thinkpads, music production and physics/materials science
- Currently researching applications of physics techniques with collision detection
